This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using Keras to classify hand gestures. The model is designed to classify images into six categories: 'NONE', 'ONE', 'TWO', 'THREE', 'FOUR', 'FIVE'. The images are preprocessed using data augmentation techniques to improve the model's generalization capability.
